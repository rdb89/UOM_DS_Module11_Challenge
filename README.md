UOM DS Module 11 Challenge for scrapping the Mars website data

Seems Mars has ~12 months in a Martian year. Determined by grouping months and Sols (Martian days).

There appears to be 1967 Sols of data reported, subtracting the starting Sol from the ending Sol. However, the data information at the bottom of the table states 1894 Sols (August 7, 2012 to February 27, 2018). Appears to be a data conflict.

Visual inspection of the plot, "Average Low Temperature by Month on Mars, Year over Year", has the third (3) month as having the coldest average temperature.

The eighth (8) month of Mars is the warmest by plot visual inspection.

The found min/max values confirm the visual inspections.

*****************************************************************************

The plot, "Average Atmospheric Pressure by Month on Mars, Year over Year", shows the second (2) month has the lowest pressure while the ninth (9) month has the highest atmospheric pressure. Month 2 and month 3 are pretty close in values.

The lowest average temperature month is pretty close to the lowest atmospheric pressure month, while the highest average temperature matches up with the maximum average atmospheric pressure.

Seems to match the Ideal Gas Law: PV = nR*T. Increase in temperature corresponds to an increase in pressure.

********************************************************************************

Examining the plot, "Minimum Martian Temperatures by Sols, Year over Year (expanded)", the expanded detail show peak-to-peak maximums at ~150 and ~815 Sols. The Martian Year is ~ 665 Sols (going from 'summer to summer').

A Google internet search reveals a Martian Year as 687 Earth days. My visual determination of the Martian year is short by 22 Earth days.

Additionally, comparing Earth calendar dates to Martian Sols by ratio (over same time delta) shows an Earth day is ~0.973 Martian Sols. Vice-versa the ratio would be 1.028 to go the other direction.
